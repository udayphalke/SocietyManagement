We're constantly innovating</h3>
  <p class="serif">
It’s safe to say that no other organisation has thought as deeply about security and community management as the team at Softcare Technokraft Society. It’s why many innovative features - eIntercom, Leave at Gate, Daily Help Management - were first seen on our app. And we believe there’s always room for improvement. So we're constantly at work, experimenting with newer, better, friendlier solutions to everyday problems.</p>

All it takes is one app to simplify all interactions at your society. There’s no bulky, expensive hardware. It’s just one app to make your guard more efficient, to make the community safer, to interact with neighbours, and to manage accounts. And it’s available to every home for a whole month at the cost of a cup of coffee.

Good to go in a week</h3>

Softcare Technokraft Society is for communities of all sizes. But even those with thousands of residences go live in a week. During this time, we’ll help onboard all your residents, train and test your guards to use our guard app, configure the site to your specifications and give your residents a demo, too. All of this ensures high adoption within the community and quickly helps the committee achieve its goal of enhancing security and convenience.  <br>
